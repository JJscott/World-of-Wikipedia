What do you do when you're given a project with a scope as large as 'time' ? After a lengthy discussion and many possible ideas we decided to build a visualization of data gathered from Wikipedia, taking a look at the interactions between geolocations, dates, and IP addresses of anonymous editors over time. Introducing the World of Wikipedia!


![World of Wikipedia!][wow-logo]

A lot of Wikipedia entries, that relate to an event in human history, have both a geographic location and a time they happened: wars that took place, monuments that were built or famous people that were born. Our first challenge was to aquire a copy of Wikipedia for parsing. Luckily Wikipedia [makes this easy][wiki-download] by providing multiple ways of downloading exactly what we need. We've downloaded the latest english Wikipedia dump (no images, no talk pages, latest revisions only, final destination); a 11 GiB zip file that extracts into a single 45 GiB XML document. Fun.

We intend to extract some of the history of the world as a series of events with a location (possibly fairly rough) and a time, and then display these events on a globe as time 'plays back'. We'll display the events as particles that drop into place, with their size proportional to some measure of their importance, probably derived from the size of the Wikipedia article. The event particles will fade out or otherwise slowly disappear after their time has passed.

We aren't going to stop there. There is a wealth of metadata on each of the pages with geolocations, mostly page edits. We want to visualize the edits over time, showing data flowing from the location of the editor to the location of the article.From this we could examine whether people closer to the location in the article have more or less influence on it than people that live further away.

As an example, imagine the ["Great Buddha" Kotoku-in][wiki-buddha] in the city of Kamakura in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. The statue is a very popular tourist location that has great ties to the history of Japan, but who would add to and update it's Wikipedia page? Tourists that visit it? Historians of Japan? Researchers on the other side of the world? Local residents? We'd like to be able to answer these sorts of questions.

One problem with this is that we can only get IP addresses for anonymous edits as registered users have confidential information. A cursory investigation of the history of one article showed about half the edits to be anonymous, so we think we can still produce something interesting.

There are other visualizations that we could do, but for now we will be focusing on parsing the Wikipedia dump and getting an initial vizualization running. I (Ben) will be parsing the XML, and I (Josh) will be working on the front end in TouchDesigner. Ths system will be designed primarily be used as a software application on a moderately powerful machine. Given additional time, extensions to the visulisation could be implementated such as touch driven interface, streaming to mobile or even projection mapping.
