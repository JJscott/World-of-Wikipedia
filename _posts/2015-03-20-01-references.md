Before we begin our journey on "Another Imposibly Large Project" we must first consider the current tools out there that provide data visualization of Wikipedia and visualization on globes.

IBM's [History Flow][history-flow-link] focuses on the visualization of Wikipedia history and interactions of multiple collaborating authors. It's a simple, very data dense visualization, but gives you the general feeling of how certain pages develop over time.

Ever wonder what politicians do in their spare time? Well now you can, by subscribing to the [Congress Edits][wiki-edit-twitter-link] twitter stream, where members of congress have their Wikipedia changes tweeted live. It provides an interesting real time insight into what pages and what sort of changes are made by some of the most influential people in the world.

![][wiki-edit-edit-sound-pic]

[Awesome project][wiki-edit-sound-link] that takes the live stream of Wikipedia edits and turns them into bells chiming. You could sit here all day watching and listening to the world rearranging and adding to our collective human knowledge.

![][wiki-edit-locator-pic]

Simple [tool][wiki-edit-locator-link] that takes the live stream of Wikipedia edits made by anonymous users, and locates them on a map by their IP addresses.

Wikipedia has its own tool for looking at articles with geolocations. If you click on the globe icon next to the set of coordinates you'll get a window [as above][wiki-lincoln-memorial-link]. There is no way to specify articles by topic, date, or importance. Wikipedia shows the article by name and squeezes in as many articles as will fit in your view.

![][google-globe-pic]

Google has an experiment [The WebGL Globe][google-globe-link], which visualizes simple static data. The style and clarity is certainly worthy of note.

![][wind-visual-pic]

The Earth Wind Map community have created a very cool [wind visualiser][wind-visual-link] which acurately displays wind currents over the surface of the globe with colors and moving particles. The style and visual effects alone merit a good amount of time worth staring at the screen but once you get bored you can change the altitude of the visualistation, as well as the ocean maps.

![][anthropocene-pic]

[Anthropocene][anthropocene-link] hosts a variety of videos relating to the visualization of important information about our globe, this one in particular is a 3 mininute film titled "Welcome to the Anthropocene". It's a visualization of routes, cities, roads, railways, pipelines, cables and shipping lanes over the globe, demonstrating our influnce as humans as we inhabit and connect every corner of the world.

![][internet-census-pic]

The [Internet Census][internet-census-link] of 2012 was a (somewhat illegal) experiment that used unsecured embedded devices to track internet activity over the entire IPv4 range. The above animation shows global internet activity over a day-night cycle The full resolution version can be found [here][internet-census-big-pic].
