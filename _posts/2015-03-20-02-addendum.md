Upon further research into extraction techniques for parsing Wikipeida's .xml dump, we came acrross a really interesting [puplication][fulltext-geocoding-link] that details how to extract a geolocation from plain text references. For exmaple if a goelocation isn't explicit, but instead the text references "near Paris" then the location of the text can be determined to some degree. Furthermore they go onto explain how this process can also work for dates, extracting time components directly from the text.

And this is where we discovered evidence that the base of our project has already been acheived by someone else.

[Mapping Wikipedia][map-wiki-link] is a project to allow the user to see the geolocation of articles mapped against their page history (note: different from event history). It provides access to anylsis on the Wikipedia articles in all laguages and can visualise a largeer number of things from density, date created, word count, to number of authors and anonymous edits. The systems is aimplemented in a web browser and can be accessed from their site, although we personally found it, impossibly slow to use.

Gareth Lloyd uploaded a video of [A History of the World in 100 Seconds][100-seconds-link] which maps the locations of 15,500 events with locations extracted from wikipedia over time, creating a visulaitaion of Wikipedia's view of world history. Wikipedia has since grown larger as well as the number of articles to be extracted (45GB as opposed to the 30GB dataset G. Llyod used).

Given that the base case of our project has aleady been done we will need to make sure that we improve on these existing methods. 3d visualisation and improved user interface can be one focus, as well as the addition of meta data anaylysis on authors edits to pages, which we have not yet found examples of.


And hey, if 100 seconds video won "Best Visualization" at Matt Patterson's History Hackday in 2011, we must be on the right track!
