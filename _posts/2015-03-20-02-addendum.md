Upon further research into extraction techniques for parsing Wikipeida's XML dump, we came across a really interesting [publication][fulltext-geocoding-link] that details how to extract a geolocation from plain text references. For example if a geolocation isn't explicit, but instead the text references "near Paris" then the location of the text can be determined to some degree. Furthermore they go onto explain how this process can also work for dates, extracting time components directly from the text.

And this is where we discovered that the base of our project has already been achieved by someone else.

[Mapping Wikipedia][map-wiki-link] is a project to allow the user to see the geolocation of articles mapped against their page history (note: different from event history). It provides access to anaylsis of the Wikipedia articles in all languages and can visualize a large number of things like density, date created, word count, number of authors and anonymous edits. The system is implemented in a web browser and can be accessed from their site, although we personally found it impossibly slow to use.

Gareth Lloyd uploaded a video titled [A History of the World in 100 Seconds][100-seconds-link], which maps the locations of 15,500 events with locations extracted from Wikipedia over time, creating a visualization of Wikipedia's view of world history. Wikipedia has since grown larger as has the number of articles to be analysed (45GB as opposed to the 30GB dataset G. Llyod used).

Given that the base of our project has aleady been done we will need to make sure that we improve on these existing methods. 3D visualization and improved user interface can be one focus, as well as the addition of meta data anaylysis on authors' edits to pages, which we have not yet found examples of.


And hey, if the 100 seconds video won "Best Visualization" at Matt Patterson's History Hackday in 2011, we must be on the right track!
