Before we begin our journey on yet "Another Impposibly Large Project" we must first consider the current tools out there that provide data visualistation of wikipedia and visualisation on globes.

IBM's [History Flow][history-flow-link] focuses on the visualisation of wikipedia history and interactions of multiple collaborating authors. It's a simple a very data dense visualisation, but gives you the general feeling of how certain pages develop over time.

Ever wonder what ploticians do in their spare time? Well now you can, by subscribing to the [Congress Edits][wiki-edit-twitter-link] twitter stream, where members of congredd have their Wikipedia changes tweeted live. It porvides an interesting real time insight into what pages and what sort of changes are made by some of the most influential people in the world.


![][wiki-edit-edit-sound-pic]

[Awesome project][wiki-edit-sound-link] that takes the live stream of Wikiepdia edits and turns them into bells chiming. Could sit here all day watching and listening to the world rearranging and adding to the our collective human knowledge.


![][wiki-edit-locator-pic]

Simple ["tool"][wiki-edit-locator-link] that takes the live stream of Wikipedia edits made by anonymous users, and locates them on a map by backtracing their IP addresses. Not very informative by itself but will be a stepping stone in the larger project that is the World of Wikipedia.

Wikipedia has it's own tool for looking at articles with geolocations. If you click on the globe icon next to the set of co-ordinates you'll get a window [as above][wiki-lincoln-memorial-link]. This tool isn't very usefull however as there is no way to specify articles by topic, date, or importance. Wikipedia simply tries to show the article by name and squeezes in as many articles that will fit in your veiwing window.


![][google-globe-pic]

Google has an experiment [The WebGL Globe][google-globe-link], which gives the user an interface for show static data as simply visualistation. The style and clarity is certainly worthy of note but the API and end reul can end up a little clumsy.


![][wind-visual-pic]

The Earth Wind Map community have created a very cool [wind visualiser][wind-visual-link] which acurattly disaplys the wind current over the surface of the globe with colors and moving particles. The style and visual effects alone merit a good amount of time worth staring at the screen but once you get bored you can change the altitude of the visualistation, as well as the ocean maps.


![][anthropocene-pic]

[Anthropocene][anthropocene-link] hosts a variety of vides relating to the visualisation of important information about our globe, this one in particular is a 3 mininute film titled "Welcome to the Anthropocene". It's a visualization of routes cities, roads, railways, pipelines, cables and shipping lanes over the globe, demonstrating our influnce as humans as inhabit and connect every corner of the world.
