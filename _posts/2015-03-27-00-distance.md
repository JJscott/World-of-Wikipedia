The primary motivation of this next post to to address a possible solution to the fundamental limitation of the Free version of Touch Designer. 1280x1280 pixels is the maximum size TOP operators can handle without prompting you to buy the pro version. This is not too much of an issue unless you want to reduce pix elation artifacts on large objects when the texture gets stretched.

A solution provided by a surprising source... the source engine. Specifically the paper; [Improved Alpha-Tested Magnification for Vector Textures and Special Effects][paper], which describes the process of creating a distance field texture that allows you to have near vector precision graphics with low a resolution texture. This would be perfect if not for one thing - creating a distance field for Earths land masses is not trivial.

After locating several sources for downloading spatiality shapefiles for WGS84, I had to determine the right way to figure out the nearest distance from the pixel to the coastline as well as whether that pixel is on land or not.


The former is probably the trickiest part. After various naive methods I have found that you cannot simply compute the distance with lat/lon , but instead must compute the [Great Circle Distance][circle-dis] between the edge and the given point representing the pixel. Unfortunately this also means that you can not use a simple structure to speed things up without converting the coordinate system to 3D and using something like an octree.


The later is solved by using winding numbers to determine whether the pixel is in a given polygon. Because the polygons are arbitrary in term of convexity, overlap and size, it is necessary to use winding numbers to test in an efficient way, for which I have used [this paper][winding-paper]. Essentially for each row of pixels that the shape overlaps you store the list of edges that overlap them, then when you query if a pixel is in the shape you only have to test against the list of edges stored for that row. Typically this reduces the comparisons down to approx 2, for most cases which reduces the compute time significantly.


After many attempts this is as far as I've gotten with these methods. Notice the artifacts in the northern hemisphere and the lines inside the continents used to define the lakes within the land boundaries - issues I've yet to tackle.

![I know.... not what I wanted exactly][distance-pic]

And due to the restraint on time I've decided to put this part on hold until I get closer with the rest of the project. Will update again if I make more progress on the distance field.
