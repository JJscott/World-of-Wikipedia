We’re done. Yay.

![World of Wikipedia!][wow-logo]

World of Wikipedia is a visualization of information collected from the English Wikipedia. We have performed a comprehensive analysis using fulltext geocoding to extract locations and magic to extract related dates to compile a list of 11,540,724 historical events as recorded by Wikipedia articles. These events are shown on a 3D globe as the timeline plays back. The user can rotate the view and seek through the timeline as they wish.

Although we were successful in our primary aim, some things didn't quite make it. The real time functionality is merely a façade. The idea was to track edits to Wikipedia articles in real time, geolocating anonymous editors by their IP addresses and using an approximate geolocation for the article, with particles representing data flowing from the editor to the article. The IRC bot and the IP geolocator are fully implemented and tested but were not integrated due to the lack of proper threading support in Touch Designer.

Another feature missing is the planned high quality Earth texture using Valve’s distance field based improved alpha-tested magnification. I (Josh) was close to creating a distance field we could use, but things such as the limitations of the dataset and the time it took to process made development slow and eventually the idea had to be abandoned in favour of finishing more important parts of the project.

There are several things we wanted to implement that never got any development at all, due to rapidly depleting stocks of time. We wanted event mouse-over to display some ‘hover-text’ with the event description, and events themselves to serve as hyperlinks to the articles they came from. We also wanted to be able to filter events by a user-enterable search query.

In addition to implementing the features we were close to finishing above we could explore other areas of meta analysis of Wikipedia. One of these could be to look at specific articles and their edit history, mapping editors’ IPs to the location associated with the article - this could give us insight into whether people closer to an article are the ones who are more likely to edit it.

Improvements to the UI would also be an important change. Giving more information about events with colour or size to represent something could give the user a greater sense of the history that is occurring during playback.

Touch Designer is an interesting development tool. While still in its infancy it has surpassed its predecessors such as Houdini in some ways. Instant visualization of intermediate components (textures, channels, tables) make it easy to debug and rapidly prototype new features. However as it is still young the support for more technical aspects is lacking, and this is clearly visible in the lack of breadth in the forums. Issues such as the specifics of how it handles Python scripts are poorly communicated, making it difficult for programmers (like us) to use.

Thanks to our resident comic book hero lookalike Rhazes for helping us get this project to where it is. We hope to revisit it at some point (quite, quite far) in the future. Josh and Ben signing off.

I give us a B- for scope on this project. We’re slipping a bit.
